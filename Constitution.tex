			\item The amount or maximum amount of the payment for the goods does not exceed what is reasonable in the circumstances for the supply of the goods in question.
			\item The other Trustees are satisfied that it is in the best interests of the charity to contract with the supplier rather than with someone who is not a Trustee or Connected Person.
			In reaching that decision the Executive Committee must balance the advantage of contracting with a Trustee or Connected Person against the disadvantages of doing so.
			\item The supplier is absent from the part of any meeting at which there is discussion of the proposal to enter into a contract or arrangement with the supplier with regard to the supply of goods to the JCR.
			\item The supplier does not vote on any such matter and is not to be counted when calculating whether a quorum is present at the meeting.
			\item The reason for the decision is recorded in the Minutes.

			\item withdraw from that meeting or discussion for that item after providing any information requested by the other Trustees;
			\item not be counted in the quorum for that part of the meeting or decision-making process;
			\item be absent during the vote and have no vote on the matter; and
			\item comply with any other requirement which the other Trustees resolve is necessary.
		\end{enumerate}
		\item When a Trustee has a Conflict of Interest, the other Trustees who do not have a Conflict of Interest (if they form a quorum without counting the Trustee and are satisfied that it is in the JCR's best interests to do so) may by resolution passed in the absence of the Trustee permit the Trustee to:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item continue to participate in discussions leading to the making of a decision, or to vote, or both;
			\item take any other action, not otherwise authorised, which does not involve the receipt by the Trustee or a Connected Person of any payment or material benefit from the JCR; or
			\item refrain from taking any step required to remove the conflict.
		\end{enumerate}
		\item In the event that the Executive Committee is unable to resolve a matter due to Conflicts of Interest, any Trustee may refer the matter to the College for a recommendation.

		\item \label{Cl:Saving1}All acts done at a meeting of the Executive Committee (or of a Sub-Committee of the Executive Committee), and all decisions made by the Executive Committee (or by a Sub-Committee of the Executive Committee), are valid notwithstanding the participation in any vote of a Trustee who at the time of the meeting or decision:

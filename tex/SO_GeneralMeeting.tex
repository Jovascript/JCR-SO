\npara Unless otherwise prescribed by the Constitution or Standing Orders, a simple majority vote of those present at the General Meeting shall be sufficient to pass all motions.
\npara Hereinafter, the Proposer, Seconder to the Proposition, Opposer and Seconder to the Opposition shall be referred to as ``the Speakers''.
\npara The section of the General Meeting entitled ``Motions'' as set out in S.O. 6.3.1.xi. shall follow the procedures for First Reading, Debate, Amendments and Voting described below.

\npara All Mandating Resolutions of the JCR must implicitly or explicitly include conditions for fulfilment.

\npara If there is no opposition to a motion and no member present desires further discussion, it shall be passed immediately \textit{nemine contradicente}.
\npara In the event of opposition to a motion, an Opposer and a Seconder to the Opposition shall be appointed from the floor by the Chair.  The Opposer and Seconder to the Opposition may be the same Ordinary Member.
\npara In the event that there is no opposition to the motion but further discussion is desired by a Member, the Chair may take initial points and questions from the floor in accordance with S.O. 6.9.3.2, S.O. 6.9.3.3 and S.O. 6.9.3.4.
\npara This preliminary discussion shall end if there is opposition to the motion in accordance with S.O.8.9.2.3. and Debate shall begin.

\subsection{Procedure of the Debate}
\npara The Proposer of the motion or Amendment shall have the right to begin the debate with a speech, followed by the Opposer, the Seconder to the Proposition and the Seconder to the Opposition. The Chair shall have the right to curtail speeches longer than five minutes in duration.
\npara The debate shall then pass to the floor where, when recognised by the Chair, members may make observations, propose questions to one or more of the Speakers or propose an Amendment under S.O. 6.9.4.

\subsection{Amendments}
\npara An Amendment may be proposed at any point either during the first reading of the motion or its debate up until the point of speeches of summation.
\npara Debate upon the motion is suspended immediately an Amendment to the motion is proposed.
\npara Amendments require both a Proposer and a Seconder, both of whom are Ordinary Members, unless there is no opposition to the Amendment from Ordinary Member in attendance.
\npara Amendments may not change the issue with which the motion is concerned.
\npara The specific wording of the Amendment must be immediately decided upon and will be read by the Secretary to the General Meeting.
\npara The Proposer and Seconder of the motion to be amended may accept the Amendment, provided that there is no opposition from the floor; in this eventuality the normal course of debate is resumed immediately.
\npara If the Amendment is not accepted, the Chair shall recognise an Opposer and Seconder to the Opposition, who may be the Proposer and Seconder of the motion and the Amendment will be debated according to S.O. 6.9.3 and Voted upon according to the procedure laid down in S.O. 6.9.5.  As in S.O. 6.9.2.3. the Opposer and Seconder to the Opposition may be the same Ordinary Member.
\npara Further Amendments to the motion cannot be proposed until a Vote has taken place on the current Amendment.
\npara The wording of the Amendment may be changed, at any point prior to Voting on the Amendment, at the discretion of the Proposer of the Amendment.
\npara All Amendments supported by a simple majority vote of those present shall become part of the motion.
\npara The Proposer and Seconder of the motion shall have the right to withdraw their support from the motion as amended. The Chair may appeal to the floor for another Proposer and Seconder who then assume control of the amended motion.  If either place cannot be filled, then the motion fails.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{Quorum Count}: the Quorum Count shall proceed automatically if allowed by the Chair; the Quorum of the General Meeting is thirty members; the General Meeting shall be assumed to be quorate unless a Quorum Count is requested; if found to be inquorate, the General Meeting shall adjourn for five minutes, or for up to half an hour if the Chair so determines; if quoracy is still lacking after reconvening then this shall be recorded in the Minutes and the meeting shall proceed in an advisory capacity only; further motions passed shall not become policy until the Minutes of the inquorate meeting are passed at the next Ordinary General Meeting.
\item \textit{Challenge to the Ruling of the Chair}: the Proposer of this motion must state what they think that the ruling should be; resolution is by simple majority vote of those present.
\item \textit{Secret Ballot}: requiring the support of two Ordinary Members present and voting to pass, this Procedural Motion shall force any Vote in the process of being held, but having not yet begun, to be held by Secret Ballot. The conduct of the Secret Ballot shall be fair under the charge of the Secretary to the General Meeting and the Returning Officer, and Voting must be done either through use of ballot papers, or a method unanimously supported by all Ordinary Members present. If possible the General Meeting should continue whilst the result of the Vote is determined. Secret Ballot shall overrule Vote by Physical Division.
\item \textit{No Confidence in the Chair}: this requires the support of two-thirds of those present to be passed; if passed, the member acting as Chair shall vacate the Chair for the remainder of the meeting; the Chair shall pass to the next suitable member according to S.O. 6.7.1.
\item \textit{Expulsion of Strangers}: pursuant to S.O. 6.1.1 and requiring a simple majority vote to pass, Expulsion of Strangers shall result in all non-Members being asked to leave the General Meeting.

\item \textit{Deferral}: by simple majority vote, a motion on the agenda of an Ordinary General Meeting may be deferred to the subsequent Ordinary General Meeting. Motions before Emergency or Extraordinary General Meetings may not be deferred.
\item \textit{Refer to Referendum}: by simple majority vote, resolution of a motion on the agenda of the meeting may be determined by a Referendum rather than a Vote in the meeting, in accordance with Article \ref{Art:GeneralMeeting} and S.O. 5.
\item \textit{Voting in Parts}: requiring a simple majority vote to pass, this Procedural Motion shall force the meeting to debate and vote upon the motion under consideration in the parts in which it was submitted; Voting in Parts does not force the meeting to move to a vote.
\item \textit{Vote by Physical Division}: requiring a simple majority vote to pass, this Procedural Motion shall force any Vote in the process of being held, but having not yet begun, to be held by Physical Division.  This may be overruled by Secret Ballot.
\item \textit{Move to a Vote}: requiring a simple majority vote to pass, Move to a Vote will force debate to be curtailed and the General Meeting to proceed directly to speeches of summation and then to a Vote.

\npara The Chair shall be obliged to hear any Procedural Motion put and the Proposer's reasons for proposition.

\npara All Debate shall be suspended immediately a Procedural Motion is proposed.
\npara When a Procedural Motion is put and allowed by the Chair, the Chair shall repeat the Procedural Motion which shall then take precedence over all other business except a Procedural Motion higher in the order of precedence. After the Proposer has stated their reasons, the Chair may appoint an Opposer to the motion at their discretion except in the case of Move to a Vote and Quorum Count where there shall be no Debate. All Procedural Motions except the Quorum Count and Move to a Vote may be debated in line with S.O. 6.9.3. if there is opposition, at the discretion of the Chair.

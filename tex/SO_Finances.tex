\npara Where direct control of JCR funds is delegated, at least two Trustees must have access to the account in which it is kept and the approval of at least one Trustee must be given for any transfer out of the account.
\npara Expenditure may only be made against an invoice presented to the JCR and expenditure made on the JCR's behalf may only be reimbursed against a receipt presented to the JCR, except in accordance with S.O. 8.4.8.  The Executive Committee must retain copies of all such invoices and receipts.
\npara A Trustee authorised by the Executive Committee may make expenditure, in accordance with a budget approved by the Executive Committee, or reimburse for such expenditure made on the JCR's behalf, up to a limit of 2\% of the Term's Base Income for each distinct purchase or expense.  Purchases listed on the same invoice are not distinct, neither are expenses listed on the same receipt.  The Treasurer should usually be authorised in this fashion.
\npara Subject to S.O. 8.4.4., all other expenditure and reimbursement requires the approval of the Executive Committee or, where control of funds is delegated to a Sub-Committee, the Sub-Committee.
\npara The Executive Committee (and its Sub-Committees) shall not intentionally authorise or incur expenditure (except to meet liabilities already incurred or if it is necessary to do so) in any of the following ways without the express authority of the General Meeting.

\npara The Executive Committee (or a Sub-Committee so authorised) may authorise donations to be made by way of subscription to an Affiliated Organisation in accordance with S.O. 9. or to a charitable cause to further the Objects, provided that the Committee is reasonably satisfied that the organisation in receipt of the donation is properly run and will apply the funds appropriately.
\npara The Executive Committee (or a Sub-Committee so authorised) may make grants to Undergraduates or to support Undergraduates on the basis of a costed plan for the use of the funds in furtherance of the Objects and appropriate assurances and checks that the funds will be thus applied.
\npara The Executive Committee may invest funds and delegate the management of funds in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as the trustees of a trust are permitted to do by the Trustee Act 2000.

If over 90\% of expected income is realise then, at the discretion of the JCR and MCR Executive Committees, alongside the Senior Treasurer, one half of the Safety Net may be spent by the Ball Committee on the Ball.  There must, therefore, at all times be a safety net of at least 5%.

\appnpara A financial report on the Ball shall be presented to every Ordinary General Meeting in the term of the Ball and the term beforehand to the JCR and MCR.

\appnpara By default, the JCR and MCR shall underwrite the Ball; no money shall be paid out of JCR or MCR accounts for the Ball before the General Meetings have been informed.

\appnpara It is suggested that an initial loan be made by both the JCR and MCR (through motions in their Ordinary General Meetings) to cover early costs.  The Ball Committee shall borrow an equal sum from both common rooms.

\appnpara In the event of any loss made by the Ball, all benefits to the Ball Committee, including the selling of Ball swaps and assets of the Ball, shall be realised before any loss is incurred by the JCR and MCR.  Any loss incurred shall be split equally by the JCR and MCR.  

\appnpara In the event of any profit being made by the Ball, all surplus funds and remaining assets shall be for the use of the next Ball Committee.   Accounts of such funds and assets shall be included in the Ball Treasurer's report.
